# Investment-Calculator
This project is an investment calculator coded in Java. The calculator takes an initial investment, monthly contribution, length of investment in years, and a rate of return, and it calculates the future value of the investment. I created this project because searching for an investment calculator online took too much time, so I wanted my own for easy access.
